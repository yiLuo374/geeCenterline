In this example, we are going to use the surface reflectance images provided by Landsat and PlanetScope. To concentrate on the workflow of centerline extraction, we have already upload images we need to assets of Google Earth Engine. However, users of Google Earth Engine can obtain Landsat collection directly. Instructions to upload Landsat images through Google Earth Engine is in [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C02_T1_L2)."
